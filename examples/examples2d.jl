# 2D Triangulations
# =================
#
# These examples can be loaded into Julia (Revise.jl recommended)
#
# These examples return either a SimplexGridBuilder struct which can
# be turned into a grid by calling `simplexgrid(builder)`, or
# just an ExtendableGrid.
#
# The control flags for Triangle are created based on defaults
# provided by this module which try to ensure "good" grids for
# FEM and FVM computations. These are documented !!!here.
# Occasional `options!` statements in the examples overwrite these defaults.
